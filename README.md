# pcfhomework
git repository for hello world pcf homework
long, long time ago in cubicle far, far away, coding had to be done, hence missing out on index.html
included blank staticfile, did not pull buildpack
had to explicitly call staticfile buildpack >> cf push pcfhomework -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git
conducted this lab on an old laptop, had to contend with few leftover local variables that detracted from cf experience
will update the git with these notes, donwload them to local repository and see if I can republish the app from cli
